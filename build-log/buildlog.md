Exported gerber files, sent them to JLCPCB. Right now it's Sunday, so verification is taking a while. Total is 1107 rub (15\$), 595 rub (8\$) for 5 PCBs and 512 RUB (7\$) for postage. They should be here in ~30 days.

Decided on the switches that'll be used with tvrg, it's Kailh Navy Blues.

Cloned a qmk repo as a submodule to this one, so yeah, gonna prod it with a stick for a bit.

Total spent: 1107 rub (15\$)
