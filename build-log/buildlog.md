Modified KiCAD corne-cherry pcb file to include some greets, don't judge me.

Exported gerber files, sent them to JLCPCB. Right now it's Sunday, so verification is taking a while. Total is 1107 rub, 595 rub for 5 PCBs and 512 for postage. They should be here in ~30 days.

Decided on the switches that'll be used with tvrg, it's Kailh Navy Blues.

Cloned a qmk repo as a submodule to this one, so yeah, gonna prod it with a stick for a bit.
